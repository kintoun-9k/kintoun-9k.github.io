Welcome to the power of words!
We are looking forward to sharing deep insights with readers. It will really be a collection of eclectic thought ranging from philosophy of mind to the specifics of the policy proposals that impact lives. The structure will take on as many forms as individuals that choose to become a contributor.

As the project evolves look to the [about]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/02_about.md %}) page for the creed section. This will serve as a set of distilled, core values that help describe the essence of the work being done here. If you think that these describe you, and you feel compelled to create content send us an [email]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/03.2_agathos.html %}).

There are several items that have been in the works for some time, posts of which will follow. To give some preview of the topics:

1. The case for a new-age literacy benchmark
2. Examination on the origins of value and its impacts on society
3. The phase-lock physics of love
4. The nature of human-nature in capitalism
5. The necessary and sufficient conditions for being to become corrupted

Stay tuned, stay active; in mind, in body.
