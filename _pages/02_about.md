This project is to help authors and readers better orient themselves in our world.
There are severe issues, pervasive to our kind. In the scope of the work explored here readers can expect authors to grapple with and represent information from a multitude of perspectives, with the aim at corralling truth in the process.  

Words can help free oneself from ones own ignorance, something that can be blissfully self-perpetuating without realization. Through engaging these dialectical works it is the hope that one may, in turn, begin to chip away at the marble towards discovery of the deep, self-reflective, value driven being that lay beneath.

Join us and become a better thinker, questioner, community member, human being.
